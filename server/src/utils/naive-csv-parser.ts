 * Parse a "naive CSV". A Naive CSV is one that does not properly escape " or , characters.

 * The reason we have a handrolled CSV parser instead of using an existing library is because eamusement CSVs are
 * invalid -- due to their lack of escaping. We have to do very manual parsing to actually make this work!
